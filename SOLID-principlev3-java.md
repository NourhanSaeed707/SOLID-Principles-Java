# Benefits of using SOLID principles:
- When you use all the principles of S.O.L.I.D in a combined manner, it becomes easier for you to develop software that can be managed easily.
- **Clean:** SOLID principles make code clean and standard code.
- **Maintainable:** with the help of SOLID principles our code becomes more manageable and easy to maintain.
- **Scalable:** Easy to refactor or change code.
- **Redundancy:** SOLID principles avoid redundant code.
- **Testable:** can be easily unit tested.
- **Readable:** SOLID principles make the code easy and readable.
- **Independent:** code becomes independent by reducing dependencies.
- **Reusable:** code becomes reusable.
## 1. Single responsibility principle:
- According to the single responsibility principle, each Java class must perform only one function. Multiple capabilities in a single class mashup the code, and any changes made to the code may influence the entire class. It specifies the code and makes it simple to maintain.
- Letâ€™s understand this by using an example:
- Suppose we have a class FinalExam that has 3 methods that perform 3 operations **AddQuestion()**, **ExpectedAnswer()**, **Marksdistribution()**. Now all these 3 methods perform different actions. By using the single responsibility principle, we can separate these functionalities into three separate classes to fulfil the goal of the principle.
  
public class FinalExam{
public void AddQuestion(){
//functionality of the method
}
public void ExpectedAnswer(){
//functionality of the method 
}
public void Marksdistribution(){
//functionality of the method 
} 
}
