# The Reason for SOLID Principles:
- What is SOLID and how does it help us write better code? Simply put, Martin and Feathers' design principles encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. Consequently, as our applications grow in size, we can reduce their complexity and save ourselves a lot of headaches further down the road!

## 1. Single Responsibility Principles:
- Let's begin with the single responsibility principle. As we might expect, this principle states that **a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.**
- **How does this principle help us to build better software?** Let's see a few of its benefits:
1. Testing – A class with one responsibility will have far fewer test cases.
2. Lower coupling – Less functionality in a single class will have fewer dependencies.
3. Organization – Smaller, well-organized classes are easier to search than monolithic
