# The Reason for SOLID Principles:
- What is SOLID and how does it help us write better code? Simply put, Martin and Feathers' design principles encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. Consequently, as our applications grow in size, we can reduce their complexity and save ourselves a lot of headaches further down the road!

## 1. Single Responsibility Principles:
- Let's begin with the single responsibility principle. As we might expect, this principle states that **a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.**
- **How does this principle help us to build better software?** Let's see a few of its benefits:
1. Testing – A class with one responsibility will have far fewer test cases.
2. Lower coupling – Less functionality in a single class will have fewer dependencies.
3. Organization – Smaller, well-organized classes are easier to search than monolithic

## 2. open-closed principle:
- **classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. In doing so, we stop ourselves from modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs** in an otherwise happy application.
Of course, **the one exception to the rule is when fixing bugs in existing code.**
Let's explore the concept with a quick code example. As part of a new project, imagine we've implemented a Guitar class.

- We launch the application, and everyone loves it. But after a few months, we decide the Guitar is a little boring and could use a cool flame pattern to make it look more rock and roll.
- At this point, it might be tempting to just open up the Guitar class and add a flame pattern — but who knows what errors that might throw up in our application.
Instead, **let's stick to the open-closed principle and simply extend our Guitar class**:

- By extending the Guitar class, we can be sure that our existing application won't be affected.

## 3. Liskov Substitution:
- Next on our list is Liskov substitution, which is arguably the most complex of the five principles. Simply put, **if class A is a subtype of class B, we should be able to replace B with A without disrupting the behavior of our program.**
Let's jump straight to the code to help us understand this concept:
