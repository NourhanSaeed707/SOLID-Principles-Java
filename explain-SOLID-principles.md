# What are the SOLID principles in Java?
- **SOLID**  principles are object-oriented design concepts relevant to software development. SOLID is an acronym for five other class-design principles: **S**ingle Responsibility Principle, **O**pen-Closed Principle, **L**iskov Substitution Principle, **I**nterface Segregation Principle, and **D**ependency Inversion Principle.
- SOLID is a structured design approach that ensures your software is modular and easy to maintain, understand, debug, and refactor. Following SOLID also helps save time and effort in both development and maintenance. SOLID prevents your code from becoming rigid and fragile, which helps you build long-lasting software.

# Examples:
## 1. Single responsibility principle:
- Every class in Java should have a single job to do. To be precise, there should only be one reason to change a class. Hereâ€™s an example of a Java class that does not follow the single responsibility principle (SRP):

- The **Vehicle** class has three separate responsibilities: reporting, calculation, and database. By applying SRP, we can separate the above class into three classes with separate responsibilities.
