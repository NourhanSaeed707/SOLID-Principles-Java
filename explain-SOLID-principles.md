# What are the SOLID principles in Java?
- **SOLID**  principles are object-oriented design concepts relevant to software development. SOLID is an acronym for five other class-design principles: **S**ingle Responsibility Principle, **O**pen-Closed Principle, **L**iskov Substitution Principle, **I**nterface Segregation Principle, and **D**ependency Inversion Principle.
- SOLID is a structured design approach that ensures your software is modular and easy to maintain, understand, debug, and refactor. Following SOLID also helps save time and effort in both development and maintenance. SOLID prevents your code from becoming rigid and fragile, which helps you build long-lasting software.

## Examples:
1. Single responsibility principle
