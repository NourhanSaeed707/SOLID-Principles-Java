# SOLID Principles:
## 1. Single Responsibility Principle:
- There should never be more than one reasone for a class to change. A class should have only one reasone to change(have only one job to do)
- Imagine we have a class **Payment** to pay bills and report bills and we write code for sendEmail in it, that violates **Single Responsibility Principle**
