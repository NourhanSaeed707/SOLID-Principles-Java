## 1. Single Responsibility Principle:
- There should never be more than one reasone for a class to change. A class should have only one reasone to change(have only one job to do)
- Imagine we have a class **Payment** to pay bills and report bills and we write code for sendEmail in it, that violates **Single Responsibility Principle**
- To fix that we has to have class Payment only for do anything with bills and create a new class for sendEmail. so that we achieve **Single Responsibility Principle** every class only have one job to do.

- that violates **Single Responsibility Principle** to fix that
